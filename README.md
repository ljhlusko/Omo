Leslea J. Hlusko, Franck Guy, Mario Modesto-Mata, Marina Martínez de Pinillos, Marianne F. Brasil, Ian Towle, Arthur Thiebaut, and Jean-Renaud Boisserie. Taxonomic assignments for the 3.4 Ma to 1.1 Ma hominin postcanine teeth from the Usno Formation and the Shungura Formation, Lower Omo Valley, Ethiopia.

This manuscript is posted as a pre-print on PaleorXiv: https://osf.io/preprints/paleorxiv/g7kfx_v1
and is under peer-review with PCI Paleo.

The three major sets of analyses included here were all developed by co-author Mario Modesto-Mata and are:

1) A linear discriminant analysis that provides a taxonomic prediction for an unknown hominin postcanine tooth based on its mesiodistal and buccolingual dimensions against a comparative dataset of 360 specimens with known taxon (810 teeth).
2) A hierarchical cluster analysis of morphological scores of the Omo dental specimens.
3) A hierarchical cluster analysis of occlusal 2-d cusp areas of the Omo dental specimens.
